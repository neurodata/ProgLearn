    "Here, a representation ensembling algorithm based on decision forests (Lifelong Forest) demonstrate forward and backward knowledge transfer of tasks on the CIFAR100 dataset with the labels shuffled. The experiment reproduces the benchmarking adversarial experiment ran in the paper \"A General Approach to Progressive Learning\" by Vogelstein, et al (2020).
