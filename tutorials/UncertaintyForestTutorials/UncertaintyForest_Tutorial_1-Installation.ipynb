    "# Tutorial Overview\n",
    "This set of five tutorials (installation, package setup, data setup, running, analyzing) will explain the UncertaintyForest class. After following the steps below, you should have the ability to run the code on your own machine and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Installation\n",
    "## *Goal: Clone the repository on your local machine and understand what it includes*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's clone the repository\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Open the command line on your local machine (called \"Terminal\" on Mac)\n",
    "2. Navigate to the location where you'd like to put the repository.\n",
    "    1. Find a location in a file explorer (\"Finder\" on Mac)\n",
    "    2. Type \"cd \" in the command prompt\n",
    "    3. Drag and drop the folder where you'd like to place the repository from the file explorer to the command line\n",
    "    The command prompt should show something like:\n",
    "    `bstraus@BS-Mac ~ % cd /Users/bstraus/Desktop `\n",
    "3. Type `git clone REPOSITORY_URL` where `REPOSITORY_URL` is replaced by the URL of the neurodata/progressive-learning repository (as of 2020-09-21, it is https://github.com/neurodata/progressive-learning)\n",
    "4. Wait for the process to finish. You'll know it's done because you'll see the first part of the command prompt pop up. For me, that looks like: `bstraus@BS-Mac ~ %`\n",
    "\n",
    "Congrats! You've now cloned the progressive-learning repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last step here, install the package with:\n",
    "`python3 setup.py install`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's take a tour\n",
    "Currently, you're looking at this tutorial, which lives in progressive-learning/tutorials/.\n",
    "This folder also currently houses a notebook running one of the experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root directory, we have:\n",
    "* `progressive-learning/docs` : contains files that will tell you requirements (we'll use this later), contributing guidelines, and some other administrative files\n",
    "\n",
    "* `progressive-learning/experiments` : contains notebooks and results for many of the experiments that utilize the functions/classes in the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "* `progressive-learning/proglearn` : the heart of the repository containing the python files for the progressive learning classes. We'll focus on the UncertaintyForest class which lives in the `forest.py` file in this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `progressive-learning/tests` : contains python files for various tests\n",
    "\n",
    "* `progressive-learning/tutorials` : contains python notebooks (like this one) that will guide you through using the classes in the repository and running the experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "In future notebooks of this tutorial, we'll discuss how to prepare to run the code for the UncertaintyForest class. That code lives in the `progressive-learning/proglearn/forest.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, for now, we'll prepare to do that by making a virtual environment and installing the required packages to run that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You're done with part 1 of the tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Move on to part 2 (called \"UncertaintyForest_Tutorial_2-Package-Setup\")\n"
